#### Enemies

- Ambient obstacles
  - Enemies that travel in fixed direction until they collide with a wall and then bounce (possibly splitting on bounce)
  - Static enemies that attack in a group as soon as you walk into the range of one of them
  - Static enemies that spawn more enemies as they stand still
  - Enemies that stay in a circle around the player and charge to the opposite side of the player
-	Several different types of enemies, generated using combinations of movement and attack patterns
-   Crowd patterns:
    -   Enemies that rush when they are in packs, forcing player to divide and conquer
    -   Enemies that fan out in an attempt to flank/reduce player's ability to combo
    -   Enemies that group and charge in a line one-by-one
    -   Enemies (typically dormant) that attack when can see an ally being attacked
    -   Enemies that run as soon as they see one of their pack go down
    -   Packs of enemies that are "hunters" that attempt to hide outside of player's vision and ambush
    -   Enemies that attempt to lure a player into a pack ambush
    -   Enemies that only attack when they can see/hear you
