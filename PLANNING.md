# Planning


### Game 0.0.0 - the first one

##### Gameplay
-single player survival horde mode
-wave-based, increasing difficulty w/ # of enemies and/or amount of enemy health
  -Vary enemy composition by wave, a boss every milestone reached
  -waves triggered after time, or after all enemies are killed, or some combo (next wave triggered 1 min after there is only 10 enemies left, keep the pressure on)
-high score based on # of waves / enemies killed
-what is the hook that separates this horde gameplay from other mechanics?
-enemies crushing in from all sides, restrictive sense of space might make for coherent gameplay
-tightly-tuned action that has easy-to-play, hard-to-master progression

##### Map
-top down view, player has restricted vision
-each player has own view, instead of a shared view that zooms to show all players
-large grid-like map, bigger than the players view
-obstacles (rocks, trees, etc.) can be used to hide behind/kite enemies
  -can obstacles be destoryed?
  -can obstacles block projectiles?
-you can move any direction.  Enemies can just pour in from all sides

##### Graphics
-geometric assets to start, simple aesthetics
-use color/shape to differentiate between player, enemy, projectile, background and obstacles
-sprite sheets for animation

##### Player
-player is always centered on screen
  -move around map with w a s d or arrow keys
  -mouse is crosshair
  -primary attack with the mouse, secondary attack with right click or space
-a short range power attack and a long range weaker attack
-Powerup drops from enemies to upgrade weapons/abilities/stats
-stats
  -primary weapon power
  -secondary weapon power
  -amount of health
  -health regen
  -speed
-weapons/abilities
  -dash/teleport ability, something that plays upon the restricted vision
  -a close range slash attack (link's swirly attack), effective on crowds, but encourages players to take a risk
  -sawed off shotgun/crossbow - low damage, large spread, knockback
-does player have health they can regen?  multiple lives?  can multiple players revive each other?

##### Enemies
-several different types of enemies


### Initial Ideas

- Character Classes
  - Different roles based on states, attack range
  - Stats: speed, power, health, health regen?
  - Basic skill tree to enhance states, possibly unlock new weapons?
  - xp gained from killing enemies, possibly other players
- RPG elements
  - World is randomly populated with materials needed to level up the skill tree
  - Destroy materials to collect them, gain small amounts of xp
- Leveling mechanism
  - Power-ups dropped from boss give new abilities, possibly for a limited amount of time
  - xp, skill trees, level up to gain power (xp drops, or kill them to earn xp)
  - As score goes up, player size increases, attract enemies of greater power
  	- smaller players can hang around, dangerous but there is a chance to earn  more xp
- Fighting mechanism
  - Team based PVE
  - PVP
  - Solo PVE w/ division style pvp (rogue)
  - Rounds vs. decentralized gameplay
- Other Things
  - Stealth, teleporting/dashing mechanism
  - Multiplayer
  - Minigore style hordes
  - Usurping mechanism
