# Planning


### Initial Ideas

- Character Classes
  - Different roles based on states, attack range
  - Stats: speed, power, health, health regen?
  - Basic skill tree to enhance states, possibly unlock new weapons?
  - xp gained from killing enemies, possibly other players
- RPG elements
  - World is randomly populated with materials needed to level up the skill tree
  - Destroy materials to collect them, gain small amounts of xp
- Leveling mechanism
  - Power-ups dropped from boss give new abilities, possibly for a limited amount of time
  - xp, skill trees, level up to gain power (xp drops, or kill them to earn xp)
  - As score goes up, player size increases, attract enemies of greater power
  	- smaller players can hang around, dangerous but there is a chance to earn  more xp
- Fighting mechanism
  - Team based PVE
  - PVP
  - Solo PVE w/ division style pvp (rogue)
  - Rounds vs. decentralized gameplay
- Other Things
  - Stealth, teleporting/dashing mechanism
  - Multiplayer
  - Minigore style hordes
  - Usurping mechanism
